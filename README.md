# Habit Tracker
# 💡 Capstone Project: Habit Tracker

## 📌 Project Idea:
The Habit Tracker is a simple and powerful application that helps users build and maintain positive habits.  
Users can add new habits, track their daily progress, and maintain streaks. The app also provides real-time graphs to show the user's consistency and growth over time through easy-to-understand analytics.

Additionally, users can update or delete their habits whenever needed.  
By visualizing their progress, users will stay motivated, consistent, and accountable toward their goals.

> “Small steps every day, big changes forever — track your habits and stay unstoppable.”
